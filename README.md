# zola (n√© Gutenberg)

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/getzola/zola/_apis/build/status/getzola.zola?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/getzola/zola/_build/latest?definitionId=1&branchName=master)
![GitHub all releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/getzola/zola/total)

Temporary fork of [zola](https://github.com/getzola/zola) that implements JPEG-XL image processing with [jpegxl-rs](https://github.com/inflation/jpegxl-rs).
Won't be pushed upstream due to licensing (jpegxl-rs is GPL) and the image crate intends on implementing it themselves eventually.

A fast static site generator in a single binary with everything built-in.

Documentation is available on [its site](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/) or
in the `docs/content` folder of the repository and the community can use [its forum](https://zola.discourse.group).

This tool and the template engine it is using were born from an intense dislike of the (insane) Golang template engine and therefore of 
Hugo that I was using before for 6+ sites.
